The task was to configure a simple static website using Nginx, including a custom error page for 404 errors.

Errors: Faced YAML syntax issues and Git authentication errors. Resolved by fixing playbook structur and using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Git. Verified setup with https://localhostIP
